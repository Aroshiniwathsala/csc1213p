Problem Specification : Changing the data type 
Implimantation :
class Ex006
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
	char c1='g';
	System.out.println("The character is: " +c1);
	
	int int1=(int)c1;
	System.out.println("The character is :" +int1);
	
	double d1=10.09;
	System.out.println("The character is :" +d1);
	
	int int2=(int)d1;
	System.out.println("The character is :" +int2);
	}
}


Output :
The character is: g
The character is :103
The character is :10.09
The character is :10

Conclution :
We learnt how to Change the data type
